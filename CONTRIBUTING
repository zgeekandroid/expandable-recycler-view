##Issues or Comments

If you have an idea for a feature enhancement or a bug fix, we'd love to know! We handle issue tracking using GitHub's issue system, so feel free to add your comment there. 

##Updates and Fixes
We also welcome all pull requests. We really love [good commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and atomic commits.

The `dev` branch is used for future 2.X releases, so if you're adding a feature, we ask that you target the `dev` branch. If you have a bug fix, targeting `master` is your best bet. This way, we're flexible to pull in bug fixes as soon as possible.
